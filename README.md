KnittingBoar
============

Parallel Iterative Algorithm (SGD) on Hadoop's YARN framework

* Built on top of BSP-style computation framework "Iterative Reduce" (Hadoop / YARN)
* Uses Mahout's implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as basis for worker process

Knitting Boar is an experimental machine learning application which parallelizes Mahout's Stochastic Gradient Descent on top of a new YARN based framework for Hadoop called [Iterative Reduce](https://github.com/emsixteeen/IterativeReduce)
